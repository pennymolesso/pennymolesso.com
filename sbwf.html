                    <div class="carousel-cell"> <img class="carousel-cell-image" data-flickity-lazyload="images/thesis/book/book_01.jpg" alt="SPIT BRIMMING WITH FUTURES expresses an urgent need to imagine stories about transgender, autistic people that affirm our agency and autonomy amidst a political climate that weaponizes neurodivergence to delegitimize trans experiences. The American political right’s vilification of transgender people is used to uphold structures of white supremacy and heteropatriarchy that become destabilized when rigid binary gender categories are challenged. The political right has a vested interest in keeping trans people out of public view, thus weaponizing the internet’s capacity for generating trans support networks and resources, and positing trans identity as a “social contagion” that is transmitted online. Contemporary photography has a tendency towards prioritizing visibility as an outcome of trans representation, when in reality these visual representations and their dissemination online can result in increased violence against trans people. I use ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) to produce a non-visual representation of trans embodiment. ASMR refers to a tingling sensation that begins in the scalp and emanates down the neck and spine. The sensation is triggered by sounds, usually whispering, tapping, or other soft tones. ASMR video content on social media platforms is an intimate technology; often involving personal attention and care, it fosters a connection between listener and creator that extends beyond the digital interface to produce bodily sensations. Soundscapes ground the installation’s trans narratives in physical sensations and audio-spatial presence, so that the spoken word resonates in the listener’s body. This produces a representation of transness that is not grounded in visibility, rather it produces a haunting, a force that can be felt even without being seen. The audio you hear in this exhibition references trans desire, intimacy, joy, and possibilities for alternate worlding and creating portals. Rather than act as visual representation, trans intimacy is rendered as an invisible, yet tangible feeling, asking, how will we carry each other in the dark? SPIT BRIMMING WITH FUTURES imagines what a neurodivergent, queer future could look like– where the categories of gender begin to dissolve, and society, rather than neurodivergent people, is measured by its functionality in embracing non-dominant forms of communication, embodiment, and expression." /> </div>

                    <div class="carousel-cell"> <img class="carousel-cell-image" data-flickity-lazyload="images/thesis/book/book_03.jpg" alt="Before craiglist personals became defunct, the term t4t was used to refer to a transgender person looking for another transgender person. Craigslist personals was the first place I encountered other transgender people as a teenager. Living in a small town, the t4t posts on my local craigslist board often didn't just feel like they were expressing a desire to hookup, but attempting to conjure someone into being. Almost like shouting into a cavern and waiting for an echo to shout back, some kind of sign that you are not alone here. At the time I first viewed these posts, they were the only narratives about transgender people I encountered that didn’t end in death or humiliation, when the possibility of survival felt like an absolute fantasy." /> </div>
                    <div class="carousel-cell"> <img class="carousel-cell-image" data-flickity-lazyload="images/thesis/book/book_04.jpg" alt="The movie Carrie (1976) portrays Carrie as an autistic coded character, who is taunted by peers for her inability to adequately adhere to expectations of femininity and sexuality. Carrie possesses telekinetic powers that are typically triggered by intense, overstimulating situations where she is unable to communicate verbally. Carrie is drenched in pig blood. I’m being drenched in fluid that comes out of my own mouth. Carrie’s telekinesis renders her body a weapon. My body is weaponized and pathologized as an autistic person. The identities that congeal inside of my body– trans and autistic– are being weaponized by the political right in order to delegitimize one another, to pass legislation that perpetuates america’s continued legacy of eugenics. I want everything to collapse, to catch fire, I want agency, I want trans life expectancy, I want to be the weapon. What happens when I am tired of surviving and I’d rather start living? My very existence is made into a weapon. A hammer, a claw machine, a lesbian, a trans man, illegible, ancient corpse under so much pressure it crystallizes, a crack in the foundation. The house is folding in half. I’m in public and I’m a weapon, and now it’s time– time to let joy make my body writhe, for the whole goddamn world to function differently instead." /> </div>
